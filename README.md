<h2>🧐 Features</h2>

So... it's a christmas tree... just made from a PCB!

It is green, has stars on it and... it blinks!

<h2>💾 PCB Design</h2>

The schematics and PCB were designed using KiCAD 7. All the files are available in this repository.

The christmass tree is actually made up of two PCB, that slide into each other and you can solder them toghether.

<h2>💻 Built with</h2>

Technologies used in the project:

*  Microchips Attiny402 microcontroller
*  0805 LEDs and resistors
*  CR2032 battery
*  6 mm tact switch for changing blink modes

<h2>📖 Documentation and project files </h2>

The CTree submodule contains all the code for the attiny, feel free to create pull requests with your own improvements!

KiCAD files has all the schematics and pcb files you might need, but if you just want to build one without making any changes,
Manufacturing files folder has all the gerber files you will need.

Under Materials you should find the current BOM and any oher useful files.

UPDIProgrammer is a python script used to flash the Attiny microcontrolller.
